        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a person who likes to keep good relationships with every single one of my friends. I would always try to organize some activities during holidays. I will ask for the schedule of every of my friends, and trying to find a day that most people are free, sometimes we just go out maybe just have a dinner or lunch together, but if my friends have a lots of free time, we are going to find some fun place so we can hang out and have more fun. Such as play basketball, billiards, Karaoke, massage, board game, etc. But no matter what we do, we would always have fun together.
      
I am a big fan of Literature classes, whether in China or the United States. Because in literature classes, I got to read many different books, so that I can learn about the world I don‚Äôt know. So maybe because of this, since I was a little kid, I have a clever mind, a unique sense of humor and a good tongue. Which is really helpful in daily life. When I stay with my friends, the atmosphere will never cool down, I am always trying to find some chat topics. If there are some unpleasant little conflicts between others, I will also use my own way to relieve the embarrassment. It‚Äôs also one of the important keys of a good relationship, So my friends like to stay with me too.
      
When I was a little Child, there was a word that usually appeared in my teacher's comments for me and my mom liked to say it when she introduced me. The word is ‚Äúhelpfulness‚Äù. I am always happy to help others. During my middle school, we had a soccer game in our grade. There was a kid in my class who really wanted to play, but he‚Äôs not good at soccer, or even just said he didn't know how to play soccer. I volunteered to ask him if he needed my help, and he readily accepted. For the next week, every day after school, I would take him to the football field and learn from the beginning about how to pass, dribble, shoot and defend. The next week, the football game began and he got a chance to play, reflecting our training results with his performance on the field. We both enjoyed the training week. And personally, being able to use my own expertise to help others is the point that makes me feel really very happy.

        I am greatly interested in Marketing as I obtain strong communication skills. When I was young, influenced by my parents, I had been an avid reader and proficient writer. I was fascinated by the colorful literature from ancient China to World Literacy. Through reading different types of novels and experiencing this unique art form, I can appreciate the inner beauty of different works by different authors. An Abundance of reading experience has made my thinking more broad and diverse, and at the same time it can make me more tolerant and easier to accept new things. Because of this, I have had a smart mind, a unique sense of humor and a multilingual skill since I was a child. My interpersonal communication skills are also increasing day by day, thanks to what I have learned in reading and having empathy. In daily life, when dealing with interpersonal relationships, I  could communicate with others and reach a mutual understanding, so as to work hard to achieve anything together. This process is communication. Having a strong communication ability can make me work more collaboratively with others. I am highly convinced that my core skills would help me succeed in the marketing field.

        My best talent is that I can learn things and master them rather fast, no matter at sports, gaming, or academia. I could become capable, adept, and effective in a short time. To start with, I could play many kinds of sports, I was Soccer Goalie for my middle school soccer team, I was a member of my middle school basketball team, I also like to play table tennis, ping-pongs, and different kinds of chess with my friends. Among them, water polo was my most proud talent and skill. I was at first scared to put my face under the water, let alone swimming. Thanks to my mother‚Äôs comfort and encouragement, I took swimming classes, and I went to swim every day at noon. I became attached to water polo, I still remember my first water polo training, I learned how to tread water and pass quickly even the coach praised me with compliments like ‚Äústrong understanding ability‚Äù. I learned how to pass, how to shoot the ball, how to dribble the ball, and skills helped me move in water. I swam faster, and every skill moved to the next advanced level. Later I was promoted from a substitute to an official member. Since that week, I was becoming more and more skillful, and my coach started to focus on training me particularly and bringing me to attend big competitions. I earned my coach‚Äôs trust by my own impeccable performance, I got a chance to play in every single game, I could score at every game, and at the end of the season our team became one of the best teams! I have gained valuable experience playing in different levels from city games to national competition. I was also successfully awarded for Chinese national Class A Athlete. After I went to high school, I kept my journey in sports. There is no doubt that learning new skills is one of the brightest colors of my life painting! I will utilize my fast-learning ability to apply into more perspectives in life and make full use of it to achieve bigger success.
